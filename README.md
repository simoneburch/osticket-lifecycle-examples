<h3>Assignment and Communication</h3>

_We'll now log in as an Agent and work from the agent's perspective:_
- On the web browser (Microsoft Edge), go to the Help Desk Login Page (http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php).
  - Log into the osTicket Help Desk using an Agent account (this example uses username **jane.doe / jane.doe@osticket.com**).
  - Once logged in, you should see the created tickets from the clients.
- Click on any available ticket (this example selects **entire mobile online banking is down**).
<p align=center>

</p>

_As an Agent, we'll observe and configure information of this ticket._

_Having the entire mobile online banking down is something that could have a major impact on the company, resulting in losing money. The severity on this should be higher and should be assigned to the departments/teams that can be responsible to resolve this issue ASAP!_
- Set Priorty from Normal to a higher level (this example uses **Emergency**).
- Assign to a higher-tier department (this example uses **System Administrators**).
- Assign a specific person(s) the responsbility to manage this ticket (this example uses the current user, **Jane Doe**).
- Modify the SLA Plan from Normal to a higher level (this example uses **SEV-A**).

_Once a ticket is resolved, it is considered "closed", so it will disappear from the Open Tickets page._<br>
_You can find it under the "Closed" tab, where you can see how many was closed at a certain time frame._
